# MLH-MakeHarvard2021

## Purpose of project
    To provide a simple way for individuals to remember and keep track of their medications
    Knows possible complications with regards to mixing of medicines
## What it does
    helps people regulate/remember medication schedules — incorporating timing, dosage, ingredient cross-referencing – by cross referencing ingredients in pills makes sure you don’t mix wrong things for bad consequences – has pictures of the medicine so it’s not overwhelming and confusing with technical names – etc. 
## Medium
### App
    Doctor inputs medicines and dosages
    App cross references medicine ingredients -> makes sure no issues with other medicines the user is taking
    App will remind user when to take medicine
    App will connect to dispenser and release proper medicines and dosages when user acknowledges the reminder
### CAD
#### Dispenser design
Spinning release mechanism (like bubble gum machine)
Pushing mechanism (like pez dispenser)
Moving belt mechanism
Medicine funnels to belt
Belt has ridges to partition individual pills
Belt moves and drops pills into tray once falls off end
Motor coded to control how many pills dropped into tray (basically setting specific number of rotations)
Trap door
Dosages manually placed into device
App tells door to open and release that day/time’s medicine
Simplest design but requires greatest involvement of user
Electronics (CAD and/or just drawing/listing necessary parts and how they would be connected)
Motors/servos?
sensors?
## Potential issues
Not very familiar with electronics
Maybe too much for 24 hours?
